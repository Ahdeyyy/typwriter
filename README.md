# Typwriter

**Typwriter** is a flexible, modern editor for [Typst](https://typst.app/), built with Tauri and Svelte. It allows you to write Typst documents, see a live preview of the compiled output, and export your documents directly to PDF, SVG and PNG.

## Acknowledgments

This project uses [Typst](https://typst.app/) as its typesetting engine.
[Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst/tree/main/) source code was very helpful in understanding how to interact with the Typst engine, I also copied some code snippets from itðŸ˜….

[Typstudio](https://github.com/Cubxity/typstudio), was instrumental in the development of this project, I used its source code as a reference.

[code-mirror-typst-lang](https://github.com/kxxt/codemirror-lang-typst) provided the Typst language support for CodeMirror, which is used in this editor.
